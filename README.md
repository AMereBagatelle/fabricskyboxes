## Purpose

This mod's purpose is to allow the specification of custom skyboxes, with any textures that you may want!

## Usage

### FSB skybox format

The documentation on this format can be found [here](docs).

### OptiFine skybox format

It is **out of the scope** of this mod to support the OptiFine format by itself. [FSB-Interop](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricskyboxes-interop) is designed as an add-on to FabricSkyboxes to achieve compatibility with the OptiFine format. Alternatively, [MCPP++](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcpppp) can be used following these [instructions](https://github.com/supsm/MCPPPP#use).
