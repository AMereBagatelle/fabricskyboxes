##### Implements custom skyboxes, similar to Optifine!

## Support

Please use the issue tracker for bugs.

## Purpose

This mod allows specification of custom skyboxes, with any textures that you may want.
You can even specify textures already in Minecraft's resources!

## Use

Documentation on the json format for skyboxes can be found [here](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/tree/1.17.x-dev/docs).

##### Disclaimer:  Does not support Optifine skybox resource packs.  This is not planned.

There are multiple projects that support converting Optifine skybox packs to FabricSkyboxes packs.  Please read their descriptions on how to use them.

## Plans

Future plans for this project include more skyboxes and more general improvements to skyboxes for creators.
