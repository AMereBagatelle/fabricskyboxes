## Purpose

This mod's purpose is to allow the specification of custom Skyboxes, with any textures that you may want!

## Usage

### FSB Skybox format

The documentation on this format can be found [here](docs).

### OptiFine Skybox format

It is **out of the scope** of this mod to support the OptiFine format. [MCPP++](https://github.com/supsm/MCPPPP) can be used to get OptiFine Skyboxes to work and you can read its [instructions](https://github.com/supsm/MCPPPP#use) on how to do that. 

## Plans

- Include more Skyboxes
- More general improvements to Skyboxes for creators
