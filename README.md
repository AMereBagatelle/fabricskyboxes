# FabricSkyboxes

##### Implements custom skyboxes, similar to Optifine!

## Support

Please use the issue tracker for bugs.

Alternatively, I now have a discord server: https://discord.gg/quvzkaV

## Purpose

This mod allows specification of custom skyboxes, with any textures that you may want.
You can even specify textures already in Minecraft's resources!

## Use

Documentation on the format for each can be found [here](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/blob/1.16.x-dev/docs/schema-v2.md).

##### Disclaimer:  Does not support Optifine skybox resource packs.  This is not planned.

MCPatcherPatcher does support this mod's format, and will be able to convert it for you.
You can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/LambdAurora/MCPatcherPatcher).
This will not be a perfect translation, you may have to manually fix some skyboxes due to implementation details.

## Plans

Future plans for this project include more skyboxes and more general improvements to skyboxes for creators.
If you feel there is a feature that is missing, you can open a issue on the issues tab.  Alternatively, come ask in the discord.
